## NextUI CLI

We are excited to introduce the [NextUI CLI](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui-cli), a command-line interface, It offers a comprehensive suite
of commands to initialize, manage, and improve your NextUI projects. It enables you to `add`, `remove`, or
`upgrade` individual components, assess the health of your project, and more.

### Installation

To install the CLI globally, execute one of the following commands in your terminal:

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    npm: "npm install nextui-cli -g",
    yarn: "yarn add nextui-cli -g",
    pnpm: "pnpm add nextui-cli -g",
    bun: "bun add nextui-cli -g",
  }}
/>

Alternatively, you can use the CLI without a global installation by employing `npx`:

```bash
npx nextui-cli@latest
```

### Usage

Once the CLI is installed, run the following command to display available commands:

```bash
nextui
```

NextUI CLI can help you create new projects, add components, upgrade components, remove components, detect issues in
you setup, know your environment, and more.

<Spacer y={4} />

To initialize a new project, you can simply run:

```bash
nextui init my-nextui-app
```

<Spacer y={4} />

You will be prompted to configure your project:

```codeBlock bash
? Select a template › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   App
    A Next.js 13 with app directory template pre-configured with NextUI (v2) and Tailwind CSS.
    Pages
    A Next.js 13 with pages directory template pre-configured with NextUI (v2) and Tailwind CSS.
```

Select the template you want to use and the CLI will create a new project for you.

> We're working on adding more templates to the CLI, so stay tuned for updates!

<Spacer y={4} />

If you already have a NextUI project, you can add components to it using the `add` command:

```bash
nextui add date-input
```

It will automatically detect the required dependencies, modify your `tailwind.config.(js|ts)` file,
detect whether using `pnpm` if so, add the required configuration to your `.npmrc` file and add the component to your project.

If instead of installing a single component you want to install multiple components, you can do so by separating them with a space:

```bash
nextui add date-input time-input calendar
```

You can alternatively install the `main` package which includes all the components by passing the `--all` flag:

```bash
nextui add --all
```

> The CLI is currentl in `Alpha` stage, we're working on adding more features and improvements. If you find any issues or have any suggestions, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui-cli/issues/new).

To learn more about the CLI and its commands, please refer to the [CLI documentation](/docs/guide/cli) and the [CLI API reference](/docs/api-references/cli-api).

## New Components

Since the beginning of NextUI, devs have been asking for date and time input components. After
months of iteration and development, we are excited to introduce the following new components:

### DateInput

DateInput is a component that allows users to enter and edit date and time values using a keyboard.
Each part of a date value is displayed in an individually editable segment.

<CodeDemo title="Usage" files={dateInputContent.usage} />

Go to the [DateInput documentation](/docs/components/date-input) to learn more about the component.

### TimeInput

The `TimeInput` component consists of a label, and a group of segments representing each unit of a time (e.g. hours, minutes, and seconds). Each segment is individually focusable and editable by the user, by typing or using the arrow keys to increment and decrement the value. This approach allows values to be formatted and parsed correctly regardless of the locale or time format, and offers an easy and error-free way to edit times using the keyboard.

<CodeDemo title="Usage" files={timeInputContent.usage} />

Go to the [TimeInput documentation](/docs/components/time-input) to learn more about the component.

### Calendar

A Calendar consists of a grouping element containing one or more date grids (e.g. months), and a previous and next button for navigating between date ranges. Each calendar grid consists of cells containing button elements that can be pressed and navigated to using the arrow keys to select a date.

<CodeDemo title="Usage" files={calendarContent.usage} />

The calendar also supports selecting years and months for rapid selection.

<CodeDemo title="With Month And Year Picker" files={calendarContent.withMonthAndYearPicker} />

Go to the [Calendar documentation](/docs/components/calendar) to learn more about the component.

### RangeCalendar

A Range calendar consists of a grouping element containing one or more date grids (e.g. months), and a previous and next button for navigating through time. Each calendar grid consists of cells containing button elements that can be pressed and navigated to using the arrow keys to select a date range. Once a start date is selected, the user can navigate to another date using the keyboard or by hovering over it, and clicking it or pressing the Enter key commits the selected date range.

<CodeDemo title="Usage" files={rangeCalendarContent.usage} />

Go to the [RangeCalendar documentation](/docs/components/range-calendar) to learn more about the component.

### DatePicker

A Date Picker combines a DateInput and a Calendar popover to allow users to enter or select a date and time value.

<CodeDemo title="Usage" files={datePickerContent.usage} />

Go to the [DatePicker documentation](/docs/components/date-picker) to learn more about the component.

### DateRangePicker

Date Range Picker combines two DateInputs and a RangeCalendar popover to allow users to enter or select a date and time range.

<CodeDemo title="Usage" files={dateRangePickerContent.usage} />

Go to the [DateRangePicker documentation](/docs/components/date-range-picker) to learn more about the component.
