## Import

NextUI exports 5 drawer-related components:

- **Drawer**: The main component to display a drawer.
- **DrawerContent**: The wrapper of the other drawer components.
- **DrawerHeader**: The header of the drawer.
- **DrawerBody**: The body of the drawer.
- **DrawerFooter**: The footer of the drawer.

<ImportTabs
  commands={{
    main: `import {
  Drawer, 
  DrawerContent, 
  DrawerHeader, 
  DrawerBody, 
  DrawerFooter
} from "@nextui-org/react";`,
    individual:
      `import {
  Drawer, 
  DrawerContent, 
  DrawerHeader, 
  DrawerBody, 
  DrawerFooter
} from "@nextui-org/drawer";`,
  }}
/>

## Usage

When the drawer opens:

- Focus is bounded within the drawer and set to the first tabbable element.
- Content behind a drawer dialog is inert, meaning that users cannot interact with it.

<CodeDemo title="Usage" files={drawerContent.usage} />

### Sizes

<CodeDemo title="Sizes" files={drawerContent.sizes} />

### Non-dissmissable

By default the drawer can be closed by clicking on the overlay or pressing the <Kbd>Esc</Kbd> key.
You can disable this behavior by setting the `isDismissable` prop to `false`.

<CodeDemo title="Non-dissmissible" files={drawerContent.nonDismissable} />

### Drawer placement

By default the drawer is righted on screens. This placement is called `right`, but
you can change it by using the `placement` prop.

<CodeDemo title="Drawer placement" files={drawerContent.placement} />

### Overflow scroll

You can use the `scrollBehavior` prop to set the scroll behavior of the drawer. The default value is `inside`.

- **inside**: The drawer content will be scrollable.
- **outside**: The drawer content will be scrollable and the drawer will be fixed.

<CodeDemo title="Overflow scroll" files={drawerContent.overflow} />

### With Form

The `Drawer` handles the focus within the drawer content. It means that you can use the drawer with
form elements without any problem. the focus returns to the trigger when the drawer closes.

<CodeDemo title="With Form" files={drawerContent.form} />

> **Note**: You can add the `autoFocus` prop to the first `Input` component to focus it when the drawer opens.

### Backdrop

The `Drawer` component has a `backdrop` prop to show a backdrop behind the drawer. The backdrop can be
either `transparent`, `opaque` or `blur`. The default value is `opaque`.

<CodeDemo title="Backdrop" files={drawerContent.backdrop} />

### Custom Backdrop

You can customize the backdrop by using the `backdrop` slot.

<CodeDemo title="Custom Backdrop" files={drawerContent.customBackdrop} />

### Custom Motion

Drawer offers a `motionProps` property to customize the `enter` / `exit` animation.

<CodeDemo title="Custom Motion" highlightedLines="14-31" files={drawerContent.customMotion} />

- **base**: The base slot of the drawer container.
- **content**: The main slot of the drawer content.
- **backdrop**: The backdrop slot, it is displayed behind the drawer.
- **header**: The header of the drawer, it is displayed at the top of the drawer.

<CodeDemo title="Custom Styles" highlightedLines="15-20" files={drawerContent.customStyles} />

## Data Attributes

- **data-open**:
  When the drawer is open. Based on drawer state.

<Spacer y={4} />

## Accessibility

- Content outside the drawer is hidden from assistive technologies while it is open.
- The drawer optionally closes when interacting outside, or pressing the <Kbd>Esc</Kbd> key.
- Focus is moved into the drawer on mount, and restored to the trigger element on unmount.
- While open, focus is contained within the drawer, preventing the user from tabbing outside.
- Scrolling the page behind the drawer is prevented while it is open, including in mobile browsers.
