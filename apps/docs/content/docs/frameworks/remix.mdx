To use HeroUI in your Remix project, you need to follow the following steps:

<Steps>

### Installation

In your Remix project, run one of the following command to install HeroUI:

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    npm: 'npm i @heroui/react framer-motion',
    yarn: 'yarn add @heroui/react framer-motion',
    pnpm: 'pnpm add @heroui/react framer-motion',
    bun: "bun add @heroui/react framer-motion"
  }}
/>

### Hoisted Dependencies Setup

<Blockquote color="primary">
**Note**: This step is only for those who use `pnpm` to install. If you install HeroUI using other package managers, you may skip this step.
</Blockquote>

If you are using pnpm, you need to add the following line to your `.npmrc` file to hoist our packages to the root `node_modules`.

```bash
public-hoist-pattern[]=*@heroui/*
```

After modifying the `.npmrc` file, you need to run `pnpm install` again to ensure that the dependencies are installed correctly.

### Tailwind CSS Setup

HeroUI is built on top of Tailwind CSS, so you need to install Tailwind CSS first. You can follow the official
[installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/remix) to install Tailwind CSS. Then you need to add 
the following code to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

<Blockquote color="primary">
**Note**: If you are using pnpm and monorepo architecture, please make sure you are pointing to the ROOT `node_modules`
</Blockquote>

```ts {2,10,15-16}
// tailwind.config.ts
const { heroui } = require("@heroui/react");

import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'

export default {
  content: [
    // ...
    // make sure it's pointing to the ROOT node_module
    "./node_modules/@heroui/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  darkMode: "class",
  plugins: [heroui()]
} satisfies Config
```

### Provider Setup

After installing HeroUI, you need to set up the `HeroUIProvider` at the `root` of your application.

Go to the src directory and inside `root.tsx`, wrap `HeroUIProvider` around App:

```tsx {9,19,24}
import {
  Links,
  LiveReload,
  Meta,
  Outlet,
  Scripts,
  ScrollRestoration,
} from "@remix-run/react";
import {HeroUIProvider} from "@heroui/react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <Meta />
        <Links />
      </head>
      <body>
        <HeroUIProvider>
          <Outlet />
          <ScrollRestoration />
          <Scripts />
          <LiveReload />
        </HeroUIProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

</Steps>
