To use HeroUI in your Vite project, you need to follow the following steps:

<Steps>

### Installation

In your Vite React project, run one of the following command to install HeroUI:

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    npm: 'npm i @heroui/react framer-motion',
    yarn: 'yarn add @heroui/react framer-motion',
    pnpm: 'pnpm add @heroui/react framer-motion',
    bun: "bun add @heroui/react framer-motion"
  }}
/>

### Hoisted Dependencies Setup

**Note**: This step is only for those who use `pnpm` to install. If you install HeroUI using other package managers, you may skip this step.
</Blockquote>

If you are using pnpm, you need to add the following line to your `.npmrc` file to hoist our packages to the root `node_modules`.

```bash
public-hoist-pattern[]=*@heroui/*
```

After modifying the `.npmrc` file, you need to run `pnpm install` again to ensure that the dependencies are installed correctly.

### Tailwind CSS Setup

NextUI is built on top of Tailwind CSS, so you need to install Tailwind CSS first. You can follow the official
[installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite#react) to install Tailwind CSS. Then you need to add 
the following code to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

<Blockquote color="primary">
**Note**: If you are using pnpm and monorepo architecture, please make sure you are pointing to the ROOT `node_modules`
</Blockquote>

```js {2,8,13-14}
// tailwind.config.js
const { heroui } = require("@heroui/react");

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ...
    "./node_modules/@heroui/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  darkMode: "class",
  plugins: [heroui()]
}
```

### Provider Setup

After installing HeroUI, you need to set up the `HeroUIProvider` at the `root` of your application.

Go to the src directory and inside `main.jsx` or `main.tsx`, wrap `HeroUIProvider` around App:

```jsx {4,10,12}
// main.tsx or main.jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import {HeroUIProvider} from '@heroui/react'
import App from './App'
import './index.css'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <HeroUIProvider>
      <App />
    </HeroUIProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

</Steps>
