# NextUI to HeroUI

HeroUI is the new identity for NextUI, bringing the same powerful components and features you love under a new name. This guide will help you migrate your existing NextUI project to HeroUI.

## Automatic Migration (Recommended)

The easiest way to migrate your NextUI project to HeroUI is using our official codemod:

<Steps>

### Run Migration

Execute the codemod in your project directory:

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    npm: "npx @vezham/codemod@latest migrate",
    pnpm: "pnpm dlx @vezham/codemod@latest migrate",
    yarn: "yarn dlx @vezham/codemod@latest migrate",
    bun: "bunx --bun @vezham/codemod@latest migrate"
  }}
/>


> **Note:** If you're using a monorepo, run the codemod from the root directory

This will automatically:
- Update all package names from `@nextui-org/*` to `@vezham/*`
- Rename component imports and references
- Update TailwindCSS configuration
- Transform provider components
- Adjust any NextUI-specific utilities or hooks
- Update `.npmrc` file pnpm only

### Install Dependencies

After running the codemod, install the new dependencies:

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    npm: "npm install",
    yarn: "yarn install",
    pnpm: "pnpm install",
    bun: "bun install"
  }}
/>

</Steps>

## Manual Migration

If you prefer to migrate manually, follow these steps:

<Steps>

### Update Dependencies

Replace NextUI packages with their HeroUI equivalents:

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    npm: "npm uninstall @nextui-org/react && npm install @vezham/react",
    yarn: "yarn remove @nextui-org/react && yarn add @vezham/react",
    pnpm: "pnpm remove @nextui-org/react && pnpm add @vezham/react",
    bun: "bun remove @nextui-org/react && bun add @vezham/react"
  }}
/>

### Update TailwindCSS Configuration

Update your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
// Before
const {nextui} = require("@nextui-org/react");

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./node_modules/@nextui-org/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  plugins: [nextui()]
};

// After
const {heroui} = require("@vezham/react");

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./node_modules/@vezham/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  plugins: [heroui()]
};
```

### Update Provider Component

Replace the NextUI provider with HeroUI's provider:

```jsx
// Before
import {NextUIProvider} from "@nextui-org/react";

// After
import {HeroUIProvider} from "@vezham/react";
```

### Update Imports

Update all component imports to use the new package name:

```jsx
// Before
import {Button, Input} from "@nextui-org/react";

// After
import {Button, Input} from "@vezham/react";
```

### Individual Packages

If you're using individual packages, update each package name:

```jsx
// Before
import {Button} from "@nextui-org/button";
import {Input} from "@nextui-org/input";
import {nextui} from "@nextui-org/theme";
import {NextUIProvider} from "@nextui-org/react";

// After
import {Button} from "@vezham/button";
import {Input} from "@vezham/input";
import {heroui} from "@vezham/theme";
import {HeroUIProvider} from "@vezham/react";
```

### Npmrc Pnpm Only

If you are using pnpm, you need to update your .npmrc file to use the new package name:

```bash
# Before
public-hoist-pattern[]=*@nextui-org/*

# After
public-hoist-pattern[]=*@vezham/*
```

</Steps>

## Verification

After migration, verify that:
1. All components render correctly
2. Theme customizations are preserved
3. No NextUI imports remain in your codebase
4. Your application builds without errors

  The functionality and API of all components remain the same - only the package names and imports have changed.
</Blockquote>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during migration, try these steps:

### NPM Users
If you're using `npm`, you may need to:
1. Delete your `node_modules` folder
2. Delete your `package-lock.json` file
3. Reinstall all packages with `npm install`

### Package.json Check
Ensure that no `@nextui-org` packages remain in your `package.json` dependencies or devDependencies.
